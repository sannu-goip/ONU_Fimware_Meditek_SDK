AHStaticRouteText=STATIC ROUTE
AHStaticRouteText1=Static routing provides a means of explicitly defining the next hop from a router for a particular destination.
AHStaticRouteText2=<b>Destination IP Address</b>:This parameter specifies the IP network address of the final destination. Routing is always based on network number. If you need to specify a route to a single host, use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.255 in the subnet mask field to force the network number to be identical to the host ID.<br><b>Gateway IP Address</b>:The gateway is a router or switch on the same network segment as the device&#39;s LAN or WAN port. The gateway helps forward packets to their destinations.
textAdvhelpSRoute=Static routes are a very quick and effective way to route data from one subnet to different subnet.You can click "Add/Apply" button after set the from to add a static route, and click "Remove" in the route table list to delete a static route.
textAdvhelpWlanMacFilter1=You can allow or deny a list of MAC addresses associated with the wireless stations access to the ADSL Router.
textAdvhelpWlanMacFilter2=Status: Use the drop down list box to enable or disable MAC address filtering.
textAdvhelpWlanMacFilter3=Action: Select Deny Association to block access to the router, MAC addresses not listed will be allowed to access the router. Select Allow Association to permit access to the router, MAC addresses not listed will be denied access to the router.
textAdvhelpdns=If "Enable Automatic Assigned DNS" checkbox is selected, this router will accept the first received DNS assignment from one of the Internet connection protocols. PPPoA, PPPoE or MER/DHCP enabled PVC(s) during the connection establishment. If the checkbox is not selected, enter the preferred and alternate DNS server IP addresses manually. Only do so if you having problems with you DNS servers.
textAdvhelpdmz1=D-Link recommends you enable the DMZ option only as a last resort if you are having trouble using an application from a computer behind the router and port forwarding does not rectify your issue. This will place your selected machine and IP address outside of the router\'s firewall protection.It is recommended that should you select to enable a DMZ zone that you do this as a troubleshooting tool and for a short period of time.
textAdvhelpdmz2=Non-UDP/TCP/ICMP LAN Sessions
textAdvhelpdmz3=LAN Sessions is normally enabled. It facilitates single VPN connections to a remote host.
textAdvhelpadslsetting=Do not change these settings unless directed by your ISP. By default the D-Link router will determine your best connection. You do not need to change any settings unless instructed by D-Link Technical Support.
textAdvhelpwirelessadv=By default these options need not be changed for this router to operate with Wireless.
textAdvhelplanadv=UPnP is used for many popular Audio Visual software. It allows the auto discovery of your device on the network. If you feel that UPnP is security concern we give you the option to disable it here.Multicast streams are used by advance network functions like IPTV and distributed by your ISP.If you enable wan ping feature, the wan port of your router will respond to ping requests from the Internet that are sent to the Wan IP address.
textAdvhelpacl=Remote Management by default should be disabled. However if you wish to login and manage your Router from another Internet device then you can enable the router to accept such commands from the Internet port. This option may be useful if your network administrator is not onsite or your technical support requires access to your router.
textAdvhelpQoS=QoS or Quality of service allows your Router to help prioritize the data packets that flow throughout your network. This is a very useful feature for sensitive applications such as VoIP whereby it will assist in preventing dropped calls. Large amounts of non-critical data can be scaled so that they do not affect sensitive real-time applications such as VoIP or Streaming. The main screen shows some pre-configured rules that are used with common applications such as VoIP, FTP and messaging programs.
textAdvhelplanqos1=Assign ATM Priority and/or IP Precedence and/or Type Of Service for the class. If non-blank value is selected for "Mark IP Precedence" and/or "Mark IP Type Of Service", the corresponding TOS byte in the IP header of the upstream packet is overwritten by the selected value.
textAdvhelplanqos2=If Differentiated Service Configuration checkbox is selected, you will only need to assign ATM priority. IP Precedence will not be used for classification. IP TOS byte will be used for DSCP mark.
textAdvhelpwlanqos1=You can give multimedia applications a higher priority in a wireless network so applications such as videos will be of higher quality.
textAdvhelpwlanqos2=Priority 7 is the highest, and priority 1 the lowest.
textAdvhelpvlan1=The "Enable VLAN Group" checkbox is to choose "Yes" or "No" turn on or off vlan function, default is off.
textAdvhelpvlan2=You can choose 0~7 to set group index.The group index will be assigned as a VLAN ID. Each group should have a specific VLAN ID, different from each other.
textAdvhelpvlan3=ATM VCs: "Port 0~7" means PVC 0~7, "Tagged" means the traffic on this PVC will take VLAN ID. 
textAdvhelpvlan4=Ethernet: "Port 1~4" means Ethernet port 1~4, you can choose each one of them. USB: You can choose USB interface. WLAN: You can choose WLAN interface.

textWlan_secTypeDescription=To protect your privacy you can configure wireless security features.  This device supports three wireless security modes including: WEP, WPA-Personal, and None. WEP is the original wireless encryption standard. WPA provides a higher level of security. WPA-Personal does not require an authentication server.
textWlan_SecType=Security Mode :
textWlanWep_Title=WEP
textWlanWep_Description1=WEP is the wireless encryption standard. To use it you must enter the same key(s) into the router and the wireless stations. For 64 bit keys you must enter 10 hex digits into each key box. For 128 bit keys you must enter 26 hex digits into each key box. A hex digit is either a number from 0 to 9 or a letter from A to F. For the most secure use of WEP set the authentication type to "Shared Key" when WEP is enabled.
textWlanWep_Description2=You may also enter any text string into a WEP key box, in which case it will be converted into a hexadecimal key using the ASCII values of the characters. A maximum of 5 text characters can be entered for 64 bit keys, and a maximum of 13 characters for 128 bit keys.

textWlanWep_Auth=Authentication
textWlanWpa_Title=WPA
textWlanWpa_Description1a=Use WPAPSK or WPA2PSKmode to achieve a balance of strong security and best compatibility. This mode uses WPAPSK for legacy clients while maintaining higher security with stations that are WPA2PSK capable. Also the strongest cipher that the client supports will be used.
textWlanWpa_Description1b= For best security, use WPA2PSK Only mode. This mode uses AES(CCMP) cipher and legacy stations are not allowed access with WPAPSK security. For maximum compatibility, use WPAPSK Only. This mode uses TKIP cipher. Some gaming and legacy devices work only in this mode.

BHSubWirelessSetupText=Wireless Setup
BHWirelessSetupText1=The wireless section is used to configure the wireless settings for your D-Link router. Note that changes made in this section may also need to be duplicated on wireless clients that you want to connect to your wireless network.
BHWirelessSetupText2=To protect your privacy, use the wireless security mode to configure the wireless security features.
BHWirelessSetupText3=<DT>Enable Wireless <DD>This option turns off and on the wireless connection feature of the router. When you set this option, the following parameters are in effect.
BHWirelessSetupText4=<DT>SSID <DD>When you are browsing for available wireless networks, this is the name that will appear in the list (unless Access Point is set to Hidden, see below). For security purposes, it is highly recommended to change from the pre-configured network name. 
BHWirelessSetupText5=<DT>Channel <DD>802.11b and 802.11g use channels to limit interference from other devices. If you are experiencing interference with another 2.4GHz device such as a baby monitor, security alarm, or cordless phone, then change the channel on your router.
BHWirelessSetupText6=<DT>802.11 Mode <DD>Select Mixed 802.11g and 802.11b to operate in b/g mode. Or select specified mode to use.
BHWirelessSetupText7=<DT>Hide Access Point <DD>Allows you to hide your wireless network. When this option is set to Visible, your wireless network name is broadcast to anyone within the range of your signal. If you're not using encryption then they could connect to your network. When Invisible mode is enabled, you must enter the Wireless Network Name (SSID) on the client manually to connect to the network.
BHWirelessSetupText8=<DT>Security Mode<DD>Unless one of these encryption modes is selected, wireless transmissions to and from your wireless network can be easily intercepted and interpreted by unauthorized users.
BHWirelessSetupText9=<DT>WEP<DD>
BHWirelessSetupText10=A method of encrypting data for wireless communication intended to provide the same level of privacy as a wired network. WEP is not as secure as WPA encryption. To gain access to a WEP network, you must know the key. The key is a string of characters that you create. When using WEP, you must determine the level of encryption. The type of encryption determines the key length. 128-bit encryption requires a longer key than 64-bit encryption.
BHWirelessSetupText10_1=Keys are defined by entering in a string in HEX (hexadecimal - using characters 0-9, A-F) or ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange - alphanumeric characters) format. ASCII format is provided so you can enter a string that is easier to remember. The ASCII string is converted to HEX for use over the network. Four keys can be defined so that you can change keys easily. 
BHWirelessSetupText11=<DT>Example:<DD>64-bit hexadecimal keys are exactly 10 characters in length. (12345678FA is a valid string of 10 characters for 64-bit encryption.) <DD>128-bit hexadecimal keys are exactly 26 characters in length. (456FBCDF123400122225271730 is a valid string of 26 characters for 128-bit encryption.) <DD>64-bit ASCII keys are up to 5 characters in length (DMODE is a valid string of 5 characters for 64-bit encryption.) <DD>128-bit ASCII keys are up to 13 characters in length (2002HALOSWIN1 is a valid string of 13 characters for 128-bit encryption.)
BHWirelessSetupText12=<DT>WPA<DD>(Wi-Fi Protected Access)- usually used for the larger Enterprise environment, it uses a RADIUS server and TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) encryption (instead of WEP encryption which is disabled). TKIP uses 128-bit dynamic session keys (per user, per session, and per packet keys).
BHWirelessSetupText13=<DT>WPA-PSK<DD>(Wi-Fi Protected Access - Pre-Shared Key)- WPA for home and SOHO environments also using the same strong TKIP encryption, per-packet key construction, and key management that WPA provides in the enterprise environment. The main difference is that the password is entered manually. A group re-key interval time is also required. 
BHWirelessSetupText14=<DT>WPA2 <DD>(Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)- second generation of WPA which uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead of TKIP as its encryption method. Network re-auth interval is the time in which another key needs to be dynamically issued.
BHWirelessSetupText15=<DT>WPA2-PSK <DD>(Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 - Pre-Shared Key)- suitable for home and SOHO environments, it also uses AES encryption and requires you to enter a password and an re-key interval time.
BHWirelessSetupText16=<DT>Mixed WPA2/WPA <DD>During transitional times for upgrades in the enterprise environment, this mixed authentication method allows "upgraded" and users not yet "upgraded" to access the network via the router. RADIUS server information must be entered for WPA and a as well as a group re-key interval time. Both TKIP and AES are used.
BHWirelessSetupText17=<DT>Mixed WPA2/WPA-PSK <DD>This is useful during transitional times for upgrades in the home or SOHO environment, a pre-shared key must be entered along with the group re-key interval time. Both TKIP and AES are also used.
BHWirelessSetupText18=<B>Group Key Update Interval: </B>The amount of time before the group key used for broadcast and multicast data is changed.
BHWirelessSetupText19=<B>Authentication Timeout: </B>Amount of time before a client will be required to re-authenticate.
BHWirelessSetupText20=<B>RADIUS Server IP Address: </B>The IP address of the authentication server.
BHWirelessSetupText21=<B>RADIUS Server Port: </B>The port number used to connect to the authentication server.
BHWirelessSetupText22=<B>RADIUS Server Shared Secret: </B>A pass-phrase that must match with the authentication server.
BHSubLANSetupText=LAN Setup
BHLANSetupText1=<DT>LAN Setup <DD>These are the settings of the LAN (Local Area Network) interface for the router. The router's local network (LAN) settings are configured based on the IP Address and Subnet Mask assigned in this section. The IP address is also used to access this Web-based management interface. It is recommended that you use the default settings if you do not have an existing network.
BHLANSetupText2=<DT>IP Address <DD>The IP address of your router on the local area network. Your local area network settings are based on the address assigned here. For example, 192.168.0.1. 
BHLANSetupText3=<DT>Subnet Mask<DD>The subnet mask of your router on the local area network.
BHLANSetupText4=<DT>DHCP Server Settings <DD>DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. The DHCP section is where you configure the built-in DHCP Server to assign IP addresses to the computers and other devices on your local area network (LAN).
BHLANSetupText5=<DT>Enable DHCP Server<DD>
BHLANSetupText6=Once your D-Link router is properly configured and this option is enabled, the DHCP Server will manage the IP addresses and other network configuration information for computers and other devices connected to your Local Area Network. There is no need for you to do this yourself.
BHLANSetupText7=The computers (and other devices) connected to your LAN also need to have their TCP/IP configuration set to "DHCP" or "Obtain an IP address automatically".
BHLANSetupText8=When you set Enable DHCP Server, the following options are displayed.
BHLANSetupText9=<DT>DHCP IP Address Range<DD>
BHLANSetupText10=These two IP values (from and to) define a range of IP addresses that the DHCP Server uses when assigning addresses to computers and devices on your Local Area Network. Any addresses that are outside of this range are not managed by the DHCP Server; these could, therefore, be used for manually configured devices or devices that cannot use DHCP to obtain network address details automatically.
BHLANSetupText11=Your D-Link router, by default, has a static IP address of 192.168.1.1. This means that addresses 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254 can be made available for allocation by the DHCP Server.
BHLANSetupText12=<DT>Example: <DD>Your D-Link router uses 192.168.1.1 for the IP address. You've assigned a computer that you want to designate as a Web server with a static IP address of 192.168.1.3. You've assigned another computer that you want to designate as an FTP server with a static IP address of 192.168.1.4. Therefore the starting IP address for your DHCP IP address range needs to be 192.168.1.5 or greater. 
BHLANSetupText13=<DT>Example: <DD>Suppose you configure the DHCP Server to manage addresses From 192.168.1.100 To 192.168.1.199. This means that 192.168.1.3 to 192.168.1.99 and 192.168.1.200 to 192.168.1.254 are NOT managed by the DHCP Server. Computers or devices that use addresses from these ranges are to be manually configured.
BHLANSetupText14=<DT>DHCP Lease Time <DD>The amount of time that a computer may have an IP address before it is required to renew the lease. The lease functions just as a lease on an apartment would. The initial lease designates the amount of time before the lease expires. If the tenant wishes to retain the address when the lease is expired then a new lease is established. If the lease expires and the address is no longer needed than another tenant may use the address. 
BHSubTaDText=Time and Date
BHTaDText1=<DD>The Time Configuration option allows you to configure, update, and maintain the correct time on the router's internal system clock. From this section you can set the time zone that you are in and set the Time Server. 
BHTaDText2=<DT>Current Router Time <DD>Displays the time currently maintained by the router. If this is not correct, use the following options to configure the time correctly.
BHTaDText3=<DT>Automatic Time Configuration<DD>
BHTaDText4=<DD>Select this option if you want to synchronize the router's clock to a Network Time Server over the Internet. If you are using schedules or logs, this is the best way to ensure that the schedules and logs are kept accurate.
BHTaDText5=<DT>NTP Server Used <DD>Select a Network Time Server for synchronization. You can type in the address of a time server. 
BHTaDText6=<DT>Time Zone <DD>Select your local time zone from pull down menu.
BHTaDText7=<DT>Set the Date and Time Manually <DD>If you do not have the NTP Server option in effect, you can either manually set the time for your router here, or you can click the <SPAN class=button_ref>Copy Your Computer's Time Settings</SPAN> button to copy the time from the computer you are using. (Make sure that computer's time is set correctly.)

AHSubPortForwardingText=Port Forwarding
AHPortForwardingText1=Multiple connections are required by some applications, such as internet games, video conferencing, Internet telephony, and others. These applications have difficulties working through NAT (Network Address Translation). This section is used to open multiple ports or a range of ports in your router and redirect data through those ports to a single PC on your network.
AHSubQoSSetupText=QoS Setup
AHQoSSetupText1=Quality of Service (QoS) is a means of ensuring performance by prioritizing the data packet flow for different applications. This makes it possible to ensure that time sensitive programs such as VoIP or Video Conferencing take precedence over less time sensitive programs.
AHQoSSetupText2=For ease of use, D-Link has set up a number of commonly used applications such as VoIP, FTP and MSN Messenger along with the standard ports for you to select just by ticking a tick box.
AHQoSSetupText3=More advanced controls can be set in both Wireless QoS and LAN QoS.
AHSubOutboundFilterText=Inbound/Outbound Filter
AHOutboundFilterText1=Filters can be configured to manage your incoming and outgoing traffic. Click on the Inbound and Outbound buttons to advance to the next section for further configuration.
AHOutboundFilterText2=<DT>Inbound/Outbound Filter<DD>
AHOutboundFilterText3=When you use the Port Triggering or Port Forwarding features to open specific ports to traffic from the Internet, you could be increasing the exposure of your LAN to cyberattacks from the Internet.
AHOutboundFilterText3_1= In these cases, you can use Inbound Filters to limit that exposure by specifying the IP addresses of internet hosts that you trust to access your LAN through the ports that you have opened. You might, for example, only allow access to a game server on your home LAN from the computers of friends whom you have invited to play the games on that server.
AHOutboundFilterText4=Inbound Filters can be used for limiting access to a server on your network to a system or group of systems. Filter rules can be used with Port Triggering features. Each filter can be used for several functions; for example a "Game Clan" filter might allow all of the members of a particular gaming group to play several different games for which gaming entries have been created.
AHOutboundFilterText4_1= At the same time an "Admin" filter might only allows systems from your office network to access the WAN admin pages and an FTP server you use at home. If you add an IP address to a filter, the change is effected in all of the places where the filter is used.
AHOutboundFilterText5=Outbound Filters can be used to limit LAN computer from accessing the internet. Filters can be used with Port Forwarding features. Outbound filter can be used in conjunction with the Inbound Filter to allow incoming and restrict outgoing access when playing a game over the internet or simply downloading a file.
AHSubDNSSetupText=DNS
AHDNSSetupText1=<DT>DNS <DD>Domain Name Server(DNS) is a server that translates URL/Domain Names to the corresponding IP address. Since URL/Domain Names are alphabetical, they are easier to remember. But the internet is based on IP address. For example, the URL/Domain Name www.dlink.com is actually 192.168.0.123. 
AHDNSSetupText2=<DT>DDNS <DD>The Dynamic DNS feature allows you to host a server (Web, FTP, Game Server, etc.) using a domain name that you have purchased (www.whateveryournameis.com) with your dynamically assigned IP address. Most broadband Internet Service Providers assign dynamic (changing) IP addresses. When you use a Dynamic DNS service provider, your friends can enter your host name to connect to your server, no matter what your IP address is. 
AHSubVLANText=VLAN
AHVLANText1=<DT>VLAN<DD>
AHVLANText2=Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a group of devices on one or more LANs that are configured so that they can communicate as if they were attached to the same wire, when in fact they are located on a number of different LAN segments. Because VLANs are based on logical instead of physical connections, it is very flexible for user/host management, bandwidth allocation and resource optimization.
AHVLANText3=1.Port-Based VLAN: each physical switch port is configured with an access list specifying membership in a set of VLANs.
AHVLANText4=2.ATM VLAN - using LAN Emulation (LANE) protocol to map Ethernet packets into ATM cells and deliver them to their destination by converting an Ethernet MAC address into an ATM address.
AHVLANText5=The key for the IEEE 802.1Q to perform the above functions is in its tags. 802.1Q-compliant switch ports can be configured to transmit tagged or untagged frames. A tag field containing VLAN (and/or 802.1p priority)
AHVLANText6=information can be inserted into an Ethernet frame. If a port has an 802.1Q-compliant device attached (such as another switch), these tagged frames can carry VLAN membership information between switches, thus letting
AHVLANText7=a VLAN span multiple switches. However, it is important to ensure ports with non-802.1Q-compliant devices attached are configured to transmit untagged frames. Many NICs for PCs and printers are not 802.1Q-compliant. If they
AHVLANText8=receive a tagged frame, they will not understand the VLAN tag and will drop the frame. Also, the maximum legal Ethernet frame size for tagged frames was increased in 802.1Q (and its companion, 802.3ac) from 1,518 to 1,522 bytes.
AHVLANText9=This could cause network interface cards and older switches to drop tagged frames as &quot;oversized.&quot;
AHSubFirewallDMZText=Firewall &amp; DMZ
AHSubNetworkToolsText=Network Tools
AHFirewallDMZText1=<DT>Firewall<DD>This allows you to prevent you router from Denial of Service(DOS) attacks.
AHAdvCwmpText=<DT>TR069 <DD>TR-069 is a WAN management protocol. A bidirectional SOAP/HTTP based protocol it provides the communication between the ADSL router and an Auto Configuration Server(ACS).
AHFirewallDMZText2=<DT>DMZ Host<DD>
AHFirewallDMZText3=DMZ means "Demilitarized Zone." If an application has trouble working from behind the router, you can expose one computer to the Internet and run the application on that computer.
AHFirewallDMZText4=When a LAN host is configured as a DMZ host, it becomes the destination for all incoming packets that do not match some other incoming session or rule. If any other ingress rule is in place that will be used instead of sending packets to the DMZ host; so, an active session, virtual server, active port trigger, or port forwarding rule will take priority over sending a packet to the DMZ host. (The DMZ policy resembles a default port forwarding rule that forwards every port that is not specifically sent anywhere else.)
AHFirewallDMZText5=<B>Note:</B> Putting a computer in the DMZ may expose that computer to a variety of security risks. Use of this option is only recommended as a last resort.
AHSubAdvWirelessText=Advanced Wireless
AHAdvWirelessText1=The Wireless section under Advanced contains three sections for further configurations.
AHAdvWirelessText2=<DT>Bandwidth <DD>In radio communication Bandwidth is the width of the frequency band used to transmit the data measured in hertz.
AHAdvWirelessText3=<DT>Beacon Interval <DD>A packet of information that is sent from a connected device to all other devices where it announces its availability and readiness. A beacon interval is a period of time (sent with the beacon) before sending the beacon again. The beacon interval may be adjusted in milliseconds (ms).
AHAdvWirelessText4=<DT>RTS Threshold (Request to Send Threshold) <DD>determines the packet size of a transmission through the use of the router to help control traffic flow. 
AHAdvWirelessText5=<DT>Fragmentation Threshold <DD>Used to fragment packets which help improve performance in the presence of radio frequency (RF) interference.
AHAdvWirelessText6=<DT>DTIM Interval<DD>Sets the Wake-up interval for clients in power-saving mode.
AHAdvAppFilterText1=Application Filter can categorize Internet Protocol packets based on their application layer data. 
AHAdvAppFilterText2=this feature can make possible identification of peer-to-peer programs such as ICQ,MSN which use unpredictable port numbers.
AHAdvAppFilterText3=To block data flow of these peer-to-peer network applications, use Application Filter feature is a good way.
AHAdvIpMacFilterText1=IP MAC filter will filter the packets according to the rules of white list or black list. For IP filter, you can choice the different interface, direction, source IP address, port number, destination IP address, and protocol like TCP, UDP or ICMP to decide the filter rules.For MAC filter, you can choice the different interface, direction, and MAC address to decide the filter rules.
AHAdvLanText1=<DT>UPnP</DT><DD>UPnP is short for Universal Plug and Play, which is a networking architecture that provides compatibility among networking equipment, software, and peripherals. This router has optional UPnP capability, and can work with other UPnP devices and software.</DD>
AHAdvLanText2=<DT>Block ICMP Ping</DT><DD>Pinging public WAN IP addresses is a common method used by hackers to test whether your WAN IP address is valid. If you leave this option unchecked, you are causing the router to ignore ping commands for the public WAN IP address of the router.</DD>
AHAdvLanText3=<DT>Multicast Streams</DT><DD>The router uses the IGMP protocol to support efficient multicasting -- transmission of identical content, such as multimedia, from a source to a number of recipients. This option must be enabled if any applications on the LAN participate in a multicast group. If you have a multimedia LAN application that is not receiving content as expected, try enabling this option.</DD>
