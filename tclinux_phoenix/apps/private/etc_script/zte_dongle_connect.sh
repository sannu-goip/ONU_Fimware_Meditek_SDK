# Pppd daemon applies point-to-point protocol to establish internet links over dial-up modems
# Command-line options are explained as follows:
# /dev/ttyUSB* -- Specifies the device you are going to use. 
#				  This will usually be /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1, /dev/ttyUSB2
# 115200 	   -- The speed the modem is to be set to. This is only the speed 
#				  between the PC and the modem and has nothing to do with the actual data throughput. 
# debug 	   -- Output debug information
# modem		   -- Use modem control lines. This is actually the default.
# noauth
# defaultroute -- Create an IP route after PPP comes alive. Henceforth, packets will go to the right place.
# noccp 
# nobsdcomp
# novj
# nodetach     -- Remain always a foreground process. This allows you to watch pppd run and stop it with ^C
# noipdefault 
# usepeerdns
# connect <script> -- Specifies the script that pppd must use to start things up. When you use a modem manually, 
#					  you need to go through the steps of initializing the modem, causing a dial, connecting, 
#					  logging in, and finally telling the remote computer that you would like to set the connection 
#					  to ``data communication'' mode. The <script> is the automation of this manual procedure.
